# WorkDayScheduler


Pseudo-Code: 

The html must take the users time and date from the computer. 

If the time has passed, the background is gray, if the time is now, the background is red, if the time is later it is green. So the background must be responsive to the time.

If you put an event down, if you click the save button it needs to save it to local storage. If you refresh and put a new event down, should it replace or add to the event? I think add, I think you should backspace out any event you don't want.
